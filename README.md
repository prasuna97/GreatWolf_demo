Introduction
This project involves building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that processes data related to hotel properties, reservations, revenue centers, and ancillary services. The goal is to generate summary reports for revenue and occupancy by room type, as well as ancillary revenue. The data is stored in an SQLite database, and the pipeline is designed to extract data, perform necessary transformations, and load the results into summary tables.

Database Tables
dim_property
Description: This table stores information about each property.
Columns:
PROPERTY_ID: Unique identifier for the property.
REPORT_NAME: Name of the property as it appears in reports.
PROPERTY_CODE: Shorthand code for the property.
POS_PROPERTY_CODE: Point of Sale property code.
OPEN_DATE: Date the property was opened.
ADDRESS: Address of the property.
CITY: City where the property is located.
STATE: State where the property is located.
ZIP: ZIP code of the property.
LATITUDE: Latitude coordinate of the property.
LONGITUDE: Longitude coordinate of the property.
property_inventory
Description: This table stores inventory data, such as the number of available rooms, on a daily basis for each property.
Columns:
INVENTORY_ID: Unique identifier for each inventory record.
BUSINESS_DATE: The date for which the inventory is recorded.
PROPERTY_CODE: Code identifying the property.
PROPERTY_NAME: Name of the property.
INVENTORY: Number of available rooms on the given date.
reservations
Description: This table stores reservation data, including stay dates, room categories, and room rates.
Columns:
RESERVATION_ID: Unique identifier for each reservation.
CUSTOMER_ID: Unique identifier for the customer making the reservation.
BOOKING_DATE: The date the reservation was made.
STAY_DATE: The date the customer is staying at the property.
PROPERTY_CODE: Code identifying the property where the reservation is made.
ROOM_CATEGORY: The category or type of room booked.
ROOM_RATE: The rate charged for the room.
dim_revenue_center
Description: This table stores data about revenue centers, including lines of business (LOB) associated with different services at the properties.
Columns:
CODE: Unique identifier for the revenue center.
LOC_OUTLET_NAME: Location-specific outlet name.
OUTLET_NAME: General outlet name.
LOB_SEGMENT: Segment of the line of business, such as "Grab N Go" or "Pizza Shop."
LOB: The broader line of business category.
ancillary_data
Description: This table stores transaction data related to ancillary services provided at the properties.
Columns:
CHECK_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction or check.
CHECK_DATETIME: The date and time when the transaction occurred.
LOCATION_ID: The identifier for the property or location.
REVENUECENTER_ID: The identifier for the revenue center or LOB.
CHECK_TOTAL: The total revenue amount for that specific check.
Use Case
The main objective of this project is to generate two key outputs:

Revenue and Occupancy by Room Type:

Metrics:
Rooms Sold: Total number of rooms sold for each room category.
Room Revenue: Total revenue generated from the rooms sold.
Occupancy Percentage: Percentage of available rooms occupied on a given stay date.
Dimensions:
STAY_DATE: Date of the stay.
PROPERTY: Property name.
ROOM_CATEGORY: Category of the room.
Ancillary Revenue:

Metrics:
Total Revenue: Total revenue generated from ancillary services.
RevPOR (Revenue per Occupied Room): Revenue generated per occupied room.
RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): Revenue generated per available room.
Dimensions:
Date: Date of the transaction.
Property: Property name.
LOB: Line of business.
The ETL pipeline processes the data from the above tables, performs necessary transformations using SQL queries, and generates the summary reports in CSV format.

Technology Stack and Approach
SQLite Database
For this project, SQLite was chosen as the database for several reasons:

Simplicity: SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database that is easy to set up and manage. It does not require a separate server process, making it an ideal choice for a development environment or small-scale projects.

Portability: SQLite databases are stored as single files, making them easy to move between systems or integrate with other applications.

Sufficient for the Use Case: Given the moderate size of the data and the scope of the project, SQLite provides adequate performance and features to meet the requirements.

SQLAlchemy
SQLAlchemy was used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the SQLite database:

Ease of Use: SQLAlchemy simplifies the process of creating and managing database tables, executing SQL queries, and handling connections. It provides a high-level interface that is both powerful and easy to use.

Flexibility: SQLAlchemy allows for raw SQL execution, which was leveraged in this project to perform complex SQL transformations directly within the database.

Scalability: Although SQLite is used in this project, SQLAlchemy's support for multiple database backends (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server) provides a path for easy migration to a more robust database if needed in the future.

Why This Approach?
This approach was chosen because it offers a balance between simplicity and functionality. SQLite and SQLAlchemy together provide a lightweight yet powerful solution that allows for rapid development and iteration. The focus on SQL transformations within the database ensures that the data processing is both efficient and scalable for the current use case.

Future Enhancements
Leveraging Cloud Services
As the data and business requirements grow, leveraging cloud services will be essential for scalability, performance, and cost-efficiency. Here's how the project could be enhanced using cloud technologies:

Data Storage:

Migrate from SQLite to a cloud-based database like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Azure SQL Database for better scalability and reliability.
Use Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage for storing raw data, intermediate results, and final outputs.
Data Processing:

Use AWS Glue or Google Cloud Dataflow for ETL processing. These services can handle large-scale data transformations and provide integrations with other cloud services.
Implementing Snowflake
To further enhance data processing and analytics capabilities, Snowflake can be used for both data warehousing and transformations:

Data Warehouse:

Snowflake can serve as the central data warehouse, storing all historical and real-time data.
It supports SQL-based transformations, making it easier to perform complex aggregations, joins, and other transformations directly within the data warehouse.
Data Transformations:

Implement Snowflake's Snowpipe for real-time data ingestion and transformation.
Use Snowflake's built-in features like materialized views, time travel, and data sharing to improve data accessibility and resilience.
Production Deployment
For production deployment with minimal downtime:

Containerization:

Containerize the ETL pipeline using Docker, ensuring that the environment is consistent across development, staging, and production.
CI/CD Pipeline:

Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or AWS CodePipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment of the ETL pipeline.
Monitoring and Alerting:

Set up monitoring using tools like Prometheus and Grafana or AWS CloudWatch to track performance, resource usage, and errors.
Implement alerting to notify the team of any issues that could impact data processing or availability.
Scaling for Large Data Ingestion
As data ingestion size increases, the pipeline needs to scale efficiently:

Distributed Processing:

Use distributed data processing frameworks like Apache Spark or AWS EMR to handle large-scale data transformations.
Partitioning and Parallelism:

Partition large datasets to enable parallel processing and improve query performance.
Use Snowflakeâ€™s auto-scaling features to dynamically adjust resources based on workload
